**NOTE**

You need to install our chrome extension in order to use the bookmarks and assets features of our application. But deploying the extension requires a developer account which requires a registration fee, so we are not able to deploy the extension.

You can install the extension locally by following [this article](https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/) and selecting the extension folder of this repository or you can check out the demo of how it works in the [linked video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1veD7tXfB4lP4dcABuT5OInV05q95wUt3/view?usp=sharing).
